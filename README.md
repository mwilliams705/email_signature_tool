# email_signature_tool

###Before you begin:
+ ####Java JRE15

Check your Java version using `java --version`

If the version is later than `15.0.2`, it will need to be updated.

+ ####maildev
Make sure you have `maildev` installed. (Check using `maildev --version`)

If not, install `maildev` using the node package manager (nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/) 
 
Install mail dev with `npm intall -g maildev`

Once installed test again with `maildev --version`

##Starting The Application

Once you have installed the Java JRE15 and maildev, executing the JAR file 
will open your default web browser to both localhost:705 (_email_signature_tool_) and localhost:1080 (_maildev_)
